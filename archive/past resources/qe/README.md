All the qualifying exam papers are from the department of statistics in CUHK and only for reference. Please do NOT distribute any of them before letting me know. 

Really appreciate the kind sharing of collections from Wenyu Zhang (19 PhD) for exam papers from past years, together with Qual2021 from Dongrong Li (20 PhD). Also really appreciate the help and supplement of details from Yuyang He (21 PhD) in 2022 QE paper. She contributed the whole 5020 section. 

Comments in the parentheses in 2022QE are from me/Yuyang, not the exam.
