All the qualifying exam paper are from the department of statistics in CUHK and only for reference. Please do NOT distribute any of them before letting me know. 
Really appreciate the kind sharing of collections from Wenyu Zhang (19 PhD) for exam paper from past years. Also really appreciate the help and supplement of details from Yuyang He (22 PhD) in 2022 QE paper, especially in 5020 section. 
Comments in the parenthesis in 2022QE are from me, not the exam.
